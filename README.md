# JS Adagrams

## Skills Assessed

- Writing Javascript functions with correct syntax, including:
  - only use `const` and `let` variables
  - use semi-colons where needed
  - name variables and functions with camelCase
- Practicing good git hygiene:
  - make at least three small commits with meaningful commit messages
- Practicing TDD with JavaScript and the Jest testing framework

## Goal

In this project, we will build the same Adagrams project from the Python curriculum using JavaScript running on Node.js in the terminal. Please review [the original project](https://github.com/AdaGold/adagrams-py#readme) for an explanation of the Adagrams game design.

A test suite and sample game project is provided in order to practice TDD and verify the correct implementation. A complete project will pass all of the provided tests and have coverage of at least 90%.

Note there are a handful of incomplete tests that currently throw exceptions. You should complete these tests and remove the exception.

## Getting Started

After forking and cloning this repo you should `cd` to the project directory and run:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Similar to using virtual environments in Python projects, this makes the yarn package manager download and install any dependencies for the project (such as Jest).

### When I `yarn install`, I Get a Lot of Text: What do I do?!

Managing external dependencies (packages/libraries that we use) in JavaScript projects is different than managing them in Python. In JavaScript, we use `yarn` to manage dependencies, and those dependencies have other dependencies. Our dependencies may change over time, and those dependency's dependencies change, too! It's a lot.

When we run `yarn install`, `yarn` may give us a lot of feedback about the state of our dependencies.

If we get **warnings about vulnerabilities,** it's likely that we won't worry about them, even if they're high risk or even if they're many (thousands?!).

If we get a message about `gyp: No Xcode or CLT version`, we also won't worry about it. That error is because of changing operating systems. [You are free to do some independent research to fix this if you're excited, though!](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/gyp-no-xcode-or-clt-version-detected-macos-catalina-anansewaa-38b536389e8d).

**The important thing is if we are able to run the tests.** After running `yarn install`, follow the directions in the next section to run the tests. If your tests run and fail, then that's a great place to be! If your tests won't run, then you should seek help.

### Tests

We have provided unit tests for you to run. As a reminder, a few of these unit tests are incomplete and currently throw exceptions. You should complete any incomplete tests and remove the exception. A complete project will pass all provided tests in the `test/adagrams.test.js` file. The other tests are for game logic that is provided and they may pass or fail depending upon the state of your code. However, you should focus on just the tests in `test/adagrams.test.js`.

To run the tests, in the command line, navigate to the project root and then run:

```bash
$ yarn test test/adagrams.test.js
```

After the tests run, there is a short table that summarizes the coverage for each file. You can view complete coverage details by running:

```bash
$ yarn run coverage
```

This is shorthand for the command `open coverage/lcov-report/index.html` and will open the coverage report in your default web browser.

### Adagrams Demo Game

In addition to the provided unit tests, we provided a demo game application that uses Adagrams code that you will implement. You can play the game as you implement each wave of the project and verify that game functionality begins to work, in addition to passing unit tests. Don't forget; making the demo game work is optional-- **passing the unit tests is required.**

  </summary>

You can start the demo game application with the following command:

```bash
$ yarn run demo-game
```

This will start the Adagrams prompt, and you can start a new game by typing `start` (or `start <num>` for a game with multiple players).

Once the game has started each player is prompted to play anagrams from the displayed letter bank until their turn completes. At the end of each round the player who played the best word (according to the logic you will implement in wave 4) is awarded points based on that word. Once all rounds are completed the game announced who won with the point total for that player.

The game is fairly rudimentary and has a few bugs remaining, such as needing to type 'exit' to complete your turn. If you've completed all of the waves for this project and wish to continue working on terminal JavaScript code, feel free to ask your instructors for suggestions on bug fixes or improvements to make for the game code.

#### Conclusion

Just like our Python Adagrams project, we will only build the library code that captures all of the rules. We can use this demo game code to imagine how another program may hook into our codebase for logic.

### Project Structure

This repository has a baseline structure for the project that includes several files. You will only need to modify one of them:

| File                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| src/adagrams.js       | This is the project code, your implementation should complete each of the functions. Each function is exported.                                                                                                          |
| test/adagrams.test.js | This file contains the unit tests for all functions you must implement. This file imports the functions from `adagrams.js`.                                                                                                                                                 |
| package.json          | This is the [yarn project description file](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/package-json/) for this project. It includes all of the dependencies, much like `requirements.txt` in our Python projects.      |

## Implementation Requirements

### Wave 1

Our first job is to build a hand of 10 letters. To do so, implement the function named `drawLetters` in `src/adagrams.js`. This function should have the following properties:

- No parameters
- Returns an array of ten strings
  - Each string should contain exactly one letter
  - These represent the hand of letters that the player has drawn
- The letters should be randomly drawn from a pool of letters
  - This letter pool should reflect the distribution of letters as described in the table below
  - There are only 2 available `C` letters, so `drawLetters` cannot ever return more than 2 `C`s
  - Since there are 12 `E`s but only 1 `Z`, it should be 12 times as likely to draw an `E` as a `Z`
- Invoking this function should **not** change the pool of letters
  - Imagine that the user returns their hand to the pool before drawing new letters

#### Distribution of Letters

| Letter : Qty. | Letter : Qty. |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
|     A : 9     |     N : 6     |
|     B : 2     |     O : 8     |
|     C : 2     |     P : 2     |
|     D : 4     |     Q : 1     |
|    E : 12     |     R : 6     |
|     F : 2     |     S : 4     |
|     G : 3     |     T : 6     |
|     H : 2     |     U : 4     |
|     I : 9     |     V : 2     |
|     J : 1     |     W : 2     |
|     K : 1     |     X : 1     |
|     L : 4     |     Y : 2     |
|     M : 2     |     Z : 1     |

**Note:** Making sure that the drawn letters match the rules of the letter pool can be straightforward or very difficult, depending on how you build the data structure for the letter pool. It is worth spending some time to think carefully about this.

### Wave 2

Next, we need a way to check if an input word (a word a player submits) only uses characters that are contained within a collection (or hand) of drawn letters. Essentially, we need a way to check if the word is, indeed, an anagram of some or all of the given letters in the hand.

To do so, implement the function named `usesAvailableLetters` in `src/adagrams.js`. This function should have the following properties:

- Has two parameters:
  - `input`, the first parameter, describes some input word, and is a string
  - `lettersInHand`, the second parameter, describes an array of drawn letters in a hand. You can expect this to be an array of ten strings, with each string representing a letter
- Returns either `true` or `false`
- Returns `true` if every letter in the `input` word is available (in the right quantities) in the `lettersInHand`
- Returns `false` if not; if there is a letter in `input` that is not present in the `lettersInHand` or has too much of compared to the `lettersInHand`

### Wave 3

We want a function that returns the score of a given word as defined by the Adagrams game.

Implement the function named `scoreWord` in `src/adagrams.js`. This method should have the following properties:

- Has one parameter: `word`, which is a string of characters
- Returns an integer representing the number of points
- Each letter within `word` has a point value. The number of points of each letter is summed up to represent the total score of `word`
- Each letter's point value is described in the table below
- If the length of the word is 7, 8, 9, or 10, then the word gets an additional 8 points

#### Score chart

|            Letter            | Value |
| :--------------------------: | :---: |
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T |   1   |
|             D, G             |   2   |
|          B, C, M, P          |   3   |
|        F, H, V, W, Y         |   4   |
|              K               |   5   |
|             J, X             |   8   |
|             Q, Z             |  10   |

### Wave 4

After several hands have been drawn, words have been submitted, checked, scored, and played, we want a way to find the highest scoring word. This function looks at the array of `words` and calculates which of these words has the highest score, applies any tie-breaking logic, and returns the winning word in a special data structure.

#### Objective

Implement the function named `highestScoreFrom` in `src/adagrams.js`. This method should have the following properties:

- Has one parameter: `words`, which is an array of strings
- Returns a single object that represents the data of a winning word and its score. The object should have the following keys:
  - `word`, whose value is a string of a word
  - `score`, whose value is the score of that word
- In the case of tie in scores, use these tie-breaking rules:
  - prefer the word with the fewest letters...
  - ...unless one word has 10 letters. If the top score is tied between multiple words and one is 10 letters long, choose the one with 10 letters over the one with fewer tiles
  - If the there are multiple words that are the same score and the same length, pick the first one in the supplied list

#### Process

This Wave has 3 parts:

1. Adjust the syntax for the tests for `highestScoreFrom` to run, instead of skip. To do this, find the `describe` block for the tests of `highestScoreFrom`, and change the syntax from `describe.skip` to `describe`
2. Write the pseudocode for this function, using whatever resources and references
3. Translate the pseudocode into JavaScript, using whatever resources and references

#### What If I Don't Finish This Wave?

If you do not finish part 3 of this wave (translating the pseudocode for `highestScoreFrom` to JavaScript), you are encouraged the leave the pseudocode as comments in your project submission. The goal for this wave is to practice translating logic to new JavaScript syntax.

Our primary goal here is to see your practice and thought process, and we will review accordingly with respect to the practice and work put into the project overall, even if this wave isn't finished. If you got stuck, please reflect on your process and where you got stuck in the reflection questions when you submit to project.

Please ensure that your tests still run before project submission, of course. :)

### Optional: Wave 5

Encapsulate the functions in a class named `Adagrams`!

- To export the `Adagrams` class, use the code `export default Adagrams` at the end of `adagrams.js`
- Update the test file to use the `Adagrams` class. 
- Remember, methods in classes are not comma-separated!
